**Classic Turtle Crossing Game**

Welcome to the Classic Turtle Crossing Game, a simple yet engaging game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. Your goal is to control the player, represented by a turtle, to safely cross a busy road filled with moving cars. Below is a brief overview of how to play and the components of the game.

**How to Play:**
- Use the `Up` arrow key to move the player turtle upward.
- Navigate the player across the road, avoiding collisions with the moving cars.
- Reach the top of the screen to advance to the next level.
- Be careful! Colliding with a car will end the game.

**Components:**
- **Player:** Represented by a turtle that you control. Move it vertically to cross the road.
- **Car Manager:** Controls the creation and movement of cars on the road.
- **Scoreboard:** Displays the current level and tracks your progress.
- **Screen:** The canvas where the game is displayed.

**Controls:**
- Use the `Up` arrow key to move the player turtle upward.

**Rules:**
- The game starts with the player turtle positioned at the bottom of the screen.
- Cars move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds, mimicking traffic.
- Navigate the player turtle across the road, avoiding collisions with the moving cars.
- Each successful crossing advances you to the next level, where cars move faster.
- Colliding with a car ends the game, and your score is displayed on the scoreboard.

**Installation:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the source code files (`player.py`, `car_manager.py`, `scoreboard.py`) and save them in the same directory.
3. Run the main Python script.

**Have fun playing Classic Turtle Crossing!**
